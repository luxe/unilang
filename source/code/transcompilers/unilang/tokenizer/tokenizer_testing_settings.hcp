//the tokenizer can be re-used for different levels of the file being parsed
//We feed the tokenizer the context in which it should be parsing based on these test functions
//At a higher level, we will skip over lower level token groups, and store them in a single token
//we call more and more specific tokenizers each time we parse a token in a more specific context.
