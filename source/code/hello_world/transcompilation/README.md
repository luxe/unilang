Here is where we test the unilang transcompiler from within the build itself.
Using the unilang-toolchain, we convert unilang code down into other languages.
We then run other specific language toolchains as necessary.
This is all done using unilang-specific bazel build rules.

These bazel tests have been auto-generated by the 'bazel refresh' tool.
Do not change them directly.
