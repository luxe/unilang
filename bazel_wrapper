# This is the front-end script that bootstraps and calls bazel.
# Any build commands will go through this script.
# it is expected to behave the same as the bazel command itself (with bootstraping capability / extra features).
# We may also consider bazelisk, but bazelisk would likely need bootstrapped as well.
# Regardless, we'll always want some kind of bare bones shell script to get/call other build tools.

# CONSIDER(thickey): should we really install bazel in the user's home directory?
# Are we sure they will even have a home repo?  Would it be better to install it inside the repo itself?
# I think this is fine for now.  We'll see if any problems arise.
# It may be recomended to have bazel write its cache to the home directory anyway.
